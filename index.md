## History
Passay is the descendant of the venerable [vt-password](https://code.google.com/p/vt-middleware/wiki/vtpassword) Java
library produced by the Middleware group at Virginia Tech. Passay builds on the lessons learned from vt-password,
which was [well-regarded](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3200292/password-strength-checking-library) in its own
right. Passay is more convenient, more extensible, and ready for internationalization.
